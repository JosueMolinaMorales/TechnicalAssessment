1.	What do you enjoy the most about software development?
        What I enjoy the most about software development is that you are constantly learning and never feel like you know it all. There is always something new to be learned.
        When it comes to software development, there is not one single track. You could focus in on designing, coding, security and other fields within software development. 
        Software development has helped me become a better problem solver. I have gained better researching skills ever since I started software development. I do not always know how to 
        squish a bug, so being able to research a solution and growing from that is a great feeling.


2.	Describe your ideal career progression, if there were no limitations.
        My ideal career, if there were no limitations, would be starting my career at any company, learning and growing in that company. After a couple of years in the industry, I would 
        want to create my own start up and develop an application that helps first generation college Hispanic students who's parents don't understand everything their is about college. 
        I would want this application to help parents understand what college is, how it can help their child in the future, colleges near them, tuition, scholarships, and more. Being a first 
        generation Hispanic college student, my parents were not able to help me when it came to applying for college, filling out the FAFSA form, or understanding scholarships. I would like to be able
        to help these families. I would like to start small, and continue to grow the company, by hiring more developers, translators, etc. 
        In the end, I would want to give back to my community.
