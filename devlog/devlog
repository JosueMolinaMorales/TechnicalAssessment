Backend: Using NodeJS and Express
  November 3rd 2021:
    Since I am not too familiar Javascript, I will spend some time understanding the language.
    
    Read the README.md
    "Create the Quests module for this application." 
    What are routes? Googled "What are routes in web development?"
      "Routing or router in web development is a mechanism where HTTP requests are routed to the code that handles them.
      In the Router you determine what should heppen when a user visits a certain page" - Divpusher
      Route::get('/test', function(){
          return "Hello World";
      });
      When someone opens the website /test/ subpage, it will display a Hello World text.
     
     I Googled "What are POST request?" and got a link to w3schools about HTTP Methods
      GET -> used to request data from a specified resource
      POST -> used to send data to a server to create/update a resource
      
    From Expressjs api:
      express.Router([options]) -> creates a new router object
      A router object is an instance of middleware and routes.
      
      Application
        The App object denotes the express application. 
        The app object has methods for:
          Routing HTTP requests
          Configuring middleware
          rendering HTML views
      
    What does this mean?
    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
        res.send('Welcome to the Backend API!');
    });
    From looking at expressjs.com app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)
    METHOD -> HTTPS request method
    HANDLER -> function executed when the route is matched
    app -> instance of express
    so get is our method, the current path is the homepage, and the handler just responds with "Welcome to Backend API!" on the homepage
    
    Routes provided: 
      Get all herores
        GET http://localhost:3000/heroes
        HTPP Status Code: 200
        Response Body: An Array of heroes
        
    Added Quest.js which is a class for quest objects that will be stored in QuestDS.js
    Coded out QuestDS.js with help from HeroDS.js
